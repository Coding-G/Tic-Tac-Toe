# Tic-Tac-Toe
A small, simple game of tic-tac-toe, that I made with help from a tutorial from Brocode(youtube). I added some extra stuff as well, such as the counter of wins, and the drawings. :) This was a great project for me to get a bit more understanding of javascript, although I still don't understand how 'this' is used in so many different ways. Thanks!
